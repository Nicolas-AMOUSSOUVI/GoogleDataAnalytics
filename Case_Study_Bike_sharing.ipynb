    "## Introduction\n",
    "The Cyclistic Bike Share Case Study is a capstone project for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate on \n",
    "Coursera. In this project, I will follow the data analysis process, I learned from the course: ask, prepare, \n",
    "process, analyze, share and act to analyze the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario \n",
    "\n",
    "You are a junior data analyst working on the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the company’s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "## About the company \n",
    "\n",
    "In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share service. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as *casual riders*. Customers who purchase annual memberships are *Cyclistic members*. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lily Moreno, the director of marketing, has set a clear goal: **Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members**. In order to do that, however, the team needs to better understand how annual members and casual riders differ, why casual riders would buy a membership, and how digital media could affect their marketing tactics. Moreno and her team are interested in analyzing the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Ask \n",
    "Three questions wil guide the future marketing program: \n",
    "1. How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently? \n",
    "2. Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?  \n",
    "3. How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members? \n",
    "\n",
    "Moreno has assigned you the first question to answer: **How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?** \n",
    "\n",
    "You will produce a report with the folowing deliverables:  \n",
    "1. A clear statement of the business task \n",
    "2. A description of all data sources used \n",
    "3. Documentation of any cleaning or manipulation of data \n",
    "4. A summary of your analysis  \n",
    "5. Supporting visualizations and key findings  \n",
    "6. Your top three recommendations based on your analysis"
